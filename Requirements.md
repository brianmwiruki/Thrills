Great move, Brian. Since you’re using Cursor IDE and have started with Next.js for your store, let’s create a clear, practical requirements document for your print-on-demand store — Thrills. This doc will guide you through each step of development with a product-focused and API-integrated structure in mind.

📝 Project Requirements Document: Thrills — Print on Demand Store

🔖 Project Overview

Thrills is a print-on-demand eCommerce platform built with Next.js, integrated with the Printify API for product sourcing, order fulfillment, and print partner management. The app will fetch product data, categories, and submit customer orders via API. A lightweight CMS or database will manage user data and basic store-level configurations.
